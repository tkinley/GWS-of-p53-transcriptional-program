#  Genome-wide analysis of p53 transcriptional programs 
## Preface
In reference to the YouTube guide by Alex Soupir, which provided instructions for analyzing RNA-Seq data from the publication "Genome-wide Analysis of p53 Transcriptional Programs in B Cells upon Exposure to Genotoxic Stress In Vivo," I have performed the analysis using the Nextflow nf.core pipeline instead of the traditional Bash method used in the guide. The analysis focuses solely on the sequences obtained from B cells isolated from the spleen, excluding the non-B cells obtained from the SRA Run Selector on NCBI.

## Background

This study utilizes data obtained from B cells isolated from mouse spleens that were exposed to ionizing radiation. The aim is to compare the data from mice with and without a functional p53 gene.

The researchers are interested in understanding how the p53 gene influences gene expression in B cells in response to genotoxic stress. To investigate this, they are comparing gene expression patterns between B cells from mice with and without p53 that were either exposed to ionizing radiation or kept as control/mock.

Overall, the researchers employ RNA sequencing data to explore the impact of genotoxic stress on transcriptional programs in B cells with and without p53. This investigation contributes to our understanding of the role played by the p53 gene in the cellular response to DNA damage.
